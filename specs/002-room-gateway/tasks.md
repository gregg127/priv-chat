---

## Phase 1: Setup — rooms-service Scaffold

**Purpose**: Create the new microservice skeleton. Must complete before any domain work.

- [x] T001 Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/build.gradle` with Spring Boot 4.0.4, Spring Web, Spring Security, jOOQ 3.20.4, Flyway 11.20.3, JJWT 0.12.6, Testcontainers, PostgreSQL driver — mirror `entry-auth-service/build.gradle` dependency versions exactly
- [x] T002 [P] Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/Dockerfile` — mirror `entry-auth-service/Dockerfile` exactly (Java 25, multi-stage Gradle build)
- [x] T003 [P] Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/RoomsServiceApplication.java` (Spring Boot main class) and `src/main/resources/application.yml` with datasource (`SPRING_DATASOURCE_*`), Flyway, jOOQ dialect, server port 8080, `ENTRY_AUTH_SERVICE_URL` env var, `JWT_EXPIRY_SECONDS` default 900
- [x] T004 Update `implementation/docker-compose.yml`: add `postgres-rooms` service (PostgreSQL 17, separate volume `postgres_rooms_data`, env vars `ROOMS_DB`/`ROOMS_DB_USER`/`ROOMS_DB_PASSWORD`, healthcheck); add `rooms-service` service (depends on `postgres-rooms` healthy + `entry-auth-service` healthy, env `ENTRY_AUTH_SERVICE_URL`, no published port, on `privchat-net`); add `ROOMS_SERVICE_URL` env var to `api-gateway` service

---

## Phase 2: Foundational — JWT Infrastructure + DB Schema

**Purpose**: Auth layer and database schema that block every user story. Must complete before Phase 3+.

- [x] T005 Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__create_rooms.sql`: `rooms` table with columns `id BIGSERIAL PK`, `name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL`, `creator_username VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL`, `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`, `active_member_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK(>=0)`; indexes on `(created_at DESC)` and `(creator_username)`
- [x] T006 [P] Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__create_user_room_stats.sql`: `user_room_stats` table with `username VARCHAR(64) PK`, `rooms_created_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK(>=0)`, `active_rooms_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK(>=0 AND <=10)`
- [x] T007 [P] Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/resources/db/migration/V3__create_room_audit_log.sql`: `room_audit_log` table with `id BIGSERIAL PK`, `event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK IN ('CREATE_ROOM','UPDATE_ROOM','DELETE_ROOM','UNAUTHORIZED_ATTEMPT')`, `room_id BIGINT NULLABLE`, `room_name VARCHAR(100) NULLABLE`, `actor_username VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL`, `occurred_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()`; indexes on `(actor_username, occurred_at DESC)` and `(event_type, occurred_at DESC)`
- [x] T008 Configure jOOQ DDL-based code generation in `implementation/services/rooms-service/build.gradle` using `jooq-meta-extensions`: point to V1–V3 migration SQL files, output package `com.privchat.rooms.jooq`, dialect POSTGRES — mirror `entry-auth-service` jOOQ codegen config exactly
- [x] T009 [P] Create Java record models: `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/model/Room.java`, `UserRoomStats.java`, `RoomAuditLog.java` — fields match data-model.md column definitions
- [x] T010 Add JJWT 0.12.6 dependencies to `implementation/services/entry-auth-service/build.gradle`: `implementation("io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api:0.12.6")`, `runtimeOnly("io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-impl:0.12.6")`, `runtimeOnly("io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-jackson:0.12.6")`
- [x] T010a Write failing unit test `implementation/services/entry-auth-service/src/test/java/com/privchat/auth/service/JwtServiceTest.java`: tests must cover `generateToken(username)` returning a non-null RS256 JWT, `getPublicKey()` returning non-null RSAPublicKey, and ephemeral key pair generation when env vars are blank. Run test — must fail (class doesn't exist yet).
- [x] T011 Create `implementation/services/entry-auth-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/auth/service/JwtService.java`: `@Service`; loads `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` (base64 PKCS#8 PEM) + `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` (base64 X.509 PEM) from env — if blank, generates ephemeral RSA 2048 key pair at startup; `generateToken(String username)` signs RS256 JWT with `sub=username`, `iat=now`, `exp=now+JWT_EXPIRY_SECONDS`; `getPublicKey()` returns `RSAPublicKey`
- [x] T011rev **Security Review Gate — JwtService (entry-auth)**: second-developer reviews `JwtService.java` before T012 proceeds. Checklist: RSA key pair loaded correctly, private key not logged, ephemeral mode documented, JWT expiry enforced, no hardcoded secrets. Sign off in PR review before merging T011.
- [x] T012 Create `implementation/services/entry-auth-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/auth/controller/JwksController.java`: `@RestController`; `GET /auth/jwks` returns `{ "keys": [{ "kty":"RSA","use":"sig","alg":"RS256","kid":"priv-chat-1","n":"<base64url modulus>","e":"AQAB" }] }` using `JwtService.getPublicKey()`; endpoint must be unauthenticated
- [x] T013 Update `implementation/services/entry-auth-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/auth/controller/dto/JoinResponse.java` to `record JoinResponse(String username, String token)`; update `implementation/services/entry-auth-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/auth/service/AuthService.java` to call `JwtService.generateToken(username)` and include the token in the returned `JoinResponse`
- [x] T014 Add `GET /auth/refresh-token` to `implementation/services/entry-auth-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/auth/controller/AuthController.java`: requires valid session (use existing session validation); returns `{ "token": "..." }` with a fresh JWT via `JwtService.generateToken(username)`; returns 401 if no valid session
- [x] T015 Update `implementation/services/entry-auth-service` Spring Security config to permit `GET /auth/jwks` without authentication (add `requestMatchers("/auth/jwks").permitAll()` before existing rules)
- [x] T015a Write failing unit test `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/test/java/com/privchat/rooms/security/JwksClientTest.java`: mock JWKS JSON response, assert `getPublicKey()` returns a valid RSAPublicKey with correct modulus/exponent. Run test — must fail.
- [x] T016 Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/security/JwksClient.java`: `@Component`; at startup (via constructor or `@PostConstruct`), calls `GET {ENTRY_AUTH_SERVICE_URL}/auth/jwks` using `RestClient`, parses JWKS JSON, reconstructs `RSAPublicKey` from `n` and `e` fields using `RSAPublicKeySpec`; caches key in volatile field; exposes `getPublicKey()`
- [x] T016a Write failing unit test `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/test/java/com/privchat/rooms/security/JwtServiceTest.java`: test valid RS256 token returns username; expired token throws; tampered signature throws; missing `sub` throws. Run test — must fail.
- [x] T017 Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/security/JwtService.java`: `@Service`; `validateToken(String token)` — parses JWT using JJWT, verifies RS256 signature with `JwksClient.getPublicKey()`, checks expiry; returns username (`sub` claim) on success; throws on invalid/expired token
- [x] T017a Write failing unit test `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/test/java/com/privchat/rooms/security/JwtAuthFilterTest.java`: test missing Authorization header → 401; malformed token → 401; valid token → SecurityContext populated with username. Run test — must fail.
- [x] T018 Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/security/JwtAuthFilter.java`: extends `OncePerRequestFilter`; extracts `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header; calls `JwtService.validateToken()`; on success sets `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` in `SecurityContextHolder`; on failure writes 401 JSON response `{ "error": "Authentication required" }`
- [x] T019 Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/security/SecurityConfig.java`: `@Configuration @EnableWebSecurity`; `SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS`; permit `/actuator/health`, authenticate all other requests; `addFilterBefore(jwtAuthFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)`; disable CSRF, formLogin, httpBasic
- [x] T019rev **Security Review Gate — rooms-service auth stack (T016–T019)**: second-developer reviews `JwksClient.java`, `JwtService.java`, `JwtAuthFilter.java`, `SecurityConfig.java` before T020 proceeds. Checklist: RSAPublicKey reconstruction correct, no timing oracle in JWT validation, stateless session confirmed, all endpoints authenticated except `/actuator/health`. Sign off in PR review.
- [x] T020 Create `implementation/api-gateway/src/main/java/com/privchat/gateway/proxy/RoomsProxyController.java`: `@RestController @RequestMapping("/rooms/**")`; mirrors `AuthProxyController` exactly — injects `RestClient` configured with `${services.rooms.url}`; forwards all headers except `Host` and `Content-Length` including `Authorization: Bearer`; proxies all HTTP methods
- [x] T021 Update `implementation/api-gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml` to add `services.rooms.url: ${ROOMS_SERVICE_URL:http://rooms-service:8080}` alongside existing `services.auth.url`

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — Browse and Join Public Rooms

**Story goal**: Logged-in user sees all public rooms and can click Join to enter one.
**Independent test**: Log in → see room list with cards showing name/creator/timestamp/count → click Join → button is present (chat navigation deferred to feature 003).

- [x] T022 [P] [US1] Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/controller/dto/RoomResponse.java`: Java record with fields `id`, `name`, `creatorUsername`, `createdAt` (ISO-8601 string), `activeMemberCount`; maps from `Room` model
- [x] T022a [P] [US1] Write failing integration test `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/test/java/com/privchat/rooms/repository/RoomRepositoryTest.java` (Testcontainers + postgres-rooms): assert `findAll()` returns rooms ordered newest-first; `findById()` returns correct room; missing ID returns empty Optional. Run test — must fail.
- [x] T023 [P] [US1] Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/repository/RoomRepository.java`: `@Repository`; `findAll()` returns all rooms ordered by `created_at DESC` using jOOQ DSL; `findById(Long id)` returns `Optional<Room>`; all queries use jOOQ parameterized DSL (no raw SQL string concatenation)
- [x] T024 [US1] Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/controller/RoomController.java` with `GET /rooms` (returns `List<RoomResponse>`, 200 OK, `[]` when empty) and `GET /rooms/{id}` (returns `RoomResponse` or 404 JSON error); inject `RoomRepository`; map `Room` → `RoomResponse`
- [x] T025 [US1] Create `implementation/frontend/src/lib/authContext.tsx`: React context + provider storing JWT token string in memory (React state — NOT localStorage); expose `{ token, setToken }` via `useAuth()` hook; wrap app layout so all pages can access it
- [x] T026 [US1] Create `implementation/frontend/src/lib/roomsApi.ts`: typed API client functions `fetchRooms()`, `fetchRoom(id)`, `createRoom(name?)`, `updateRoom(id, name)`, `deleteRoom(id)` — each calls the appropriate `/rooms/**` endpoint via `fetch`, includes `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` header from `useAuth()`, returns typed response or throws on non-2xx
- [x] T027 [US1] Update `implementation/frontend/src/app/portal/EntryGateClient.tsx` (or wherever `JoinResponse` is handled after login) to call `authContext.setToken(response.token)` storing the JWT in memory; redirect to `/portal/rooms` on successful login
- [x] T028 [P] [US1] Create `implementation/frontend/src/components/RoomCard/index.tsx`: functional component accepting `room: RoomResponse`; displays name, creatorUsername, createdAt (formatted), activeMemberCount, and a "Join" button; clicking Join calls `onJoin(room.id)` prop
- [x] T029 [US1] Create `implementation/frontend/src/app/portal/rooms/page.tsx`: Room Gateway page; fetches room list via `fetchRooms()` on mount; renders list of `<RoomCard>`; handles Join click (no-op — navigation to chat room is deferred to feature 003); shows loading state; redirects to `/` if no JWT in context (unauthenticated guard)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 — Create Room with Default Values

**Story goal**: User clicks "Create Room" → room created as `{username}-room-{n}` → user enters it immediately.
**Independent test**: Click "Create Room" → new room appears at top of list with correct name pattern (navigation into room deferred to feature 003).

- [x] T030 [P] [US2] Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/controller/dto/CreateRoomRequest.java`: Java record with optional `name` field (may be null); and `UpdateRoomRequest.java` with required `name` field
- [x] T031 [P] [US2] Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/repository/AuditLogRepository.java`: `@Repository`; `insert(String eventType, Long roomId, String roomName, String actorUsername)` writes one append-only row to `room_audit_log` using jOOQ DSL
- [x] T031a [US2] Write failing unit test `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/test/java/com/privchat/rooms/service/RoomServiceTest.java`: test cap enforcement (`active_rooms_count == 10` → `RoomCapException`); naming sequence (`rooms_created_count = 2` → name `alice-room-3`); custom name uniqueness conflict → 409; successful creation → correct Room returned. Run test — must fail.
- [x] T032 [US2] Create `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/service/RoomService.java`: `createRoom(String username, @Nullable String customName)` — within a single DB transaction: (1) upsert `user_room_stats` row for username; (2) check `active_rooms_count < 10`, throw `RoomCapException` if not; (3) resolve name: use `customName` if provided (check uniqueness → 409), else generate `{username}-room-{rooms_created_count+1}` (increment until unique); (4) increment both counters in `user_room_stats`; (5) insert into `rooms`; (6) write `CREATE_ROOM` audit log entry; return created `Room`
- [x] T033 [US2] Add `POST /rooms` to `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/controller/RoomController.java`: accepts `CreateRoomRequest`, calls `RoomService.createRoom()`, returns 201 with `RoomResponse`; handle `RoomCapException` → 422; handle name conflict → 409; handle validation → 400
- [x] T034 [US2] Add "Create Room" button to `implementation/frontend/src/app/portal/rooms/page.tsx`: calls `createRoom()` from `roomsApi.ts`; on 201 success, new room prepended to list and error cleared (navigation into room deferred to feature 003); on 422 response, stores cap-reached state in component state (does not throw)
- [x] T035 [US2] Disable "Create Room" button and show cap message in `implementation/frontend/src/app/portal/rooms/page.tsx` when cap-reached state is set (set on 422 from POST, or infer by counting rooms where `creatorUsername === currentUser`); button re-enables only if active rooms drop below 10 in the future

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 — Empty State

**Story goal**: When no rooms exist, user sees a helpful message and a visible "Create Room" button.
**Independent test**: Access Room Gateway with empty DB → see empty-state message and working "Create Room" button.

- [x] T036 [P] [US3] Create `implementation/frontend/src/components/EmptyState/index.tsx`: functional component; displays "No rooms yet — create one to get started" message and a "Create Room" button (calls `onCreateRoom` prop); styled to be prominent
- [x] T037 [US3] Update `implementation/frontend/src/app/portal/rooms/page.tsx` to render `<EmptyState onCreateRoom={...} />` when room list is empty (`rooms.length === 0`) in place of the room list; "Create Room" in EmptyState calls the same create handler as the main button

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 — Room Management (Rename and Delete)

**Story goal**: Creator can rename or delete their own rooms. Non-creators cannot. Deletion frees a cap slot.
**Independent test**: As creator — rename a room, verify new name in list. Delete a room, verify it disappears and cap slot is freed. As non-creator — attempt both actions via API and verify 403 + audit log.

- [x] T038 [P] [US4] Add `PUT /rooms/{id}` to `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/controller/RoomController.java` + `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/service/RoomService.java`: accepts `UpdateRoomRequest`; verifies JWT `sub` matches `creator_username` (→ 403 + `UNAUTHORIZED_ATTEMPT` audit log entry via `AuditLogRepository` if not); validates name non-empty and ≤ 100 chars (→ 400); checks global name uniqueness (→ 409); updates `rooms.name`; writes `UPDATE_ROOM` audit log; returns updated `RoomResponse`
- [x] T039 [P] [US4] Add `DELETE /rooms/{id}` to `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/controller/RoomController.java` + `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/service/RoomService.java`: verifies creator (→ 403 + `UNAUTHORIZED_ATTEMPT` audit log if not); in a single transaction: deletes room, decrements `user_room_stats.active_rooms_count`, writes `DELETE_ROOM` audit log entry with `room_name` snapshot; returns 204
- [x] T040 [US4] Add inline rename UI to `implementation/frontend/src/components/RoomCard/index.tsx`: show "Rename" button only when `room.creatorUsername === currentUser`; clicking opens an inline text input pre-filled with current name; on submit calls `updateRoom(room.id, newName)` from `roomsApi.ts`; on 200 refreshes room in list; on 409 shows "Name already taken" error inline
- [x] T041 [US4] Add delete UI to `implementation/frontend/src/components/RoomCard/index.tsx`: show "Delete" button only when `room.creatorUsername === currentUser`; clicking shows a confirmation prompt ("Delete this room?"); on confirm calls `deleteRoom(room.id)` from `roomsApi.ts`; on 204 removes room from list in state; if user was at cap, re-enables "Create Room" button

---

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [x] T042 Implement `UNAUTHORIZED_ATTEMPT` audit log writes in `implementation/services/rooms-service/src/main/java/com/privchat/rooms/service/RoomService.java` for all 403 code paths (PUT and DELETE non-creator attempts) using `AuditLogRepository`
- [x] T043 Add JWT refresh logic to `implementation/frontend/src/lib/authContext.tsx` (or a dedicated hook): check remaining JWT lifetime on each rooms API call; if < 60 seconds, call `GET /auth/refresh-token` (using session cookie) and update `token` in context before retrying the rooms API call
- [x] T044 Add real-time room list updates to `implementation/frontend/src/app/portal/rooms/page.tsx`: poll `GET /rooms` every 10 seconds (intentionally reduced from 2 s to prevent interval-restart memory leak) so newly created/deleted rooms appear within 10 seconds (FR-003, SC-003) without a full page refresh; cancel polling on component unmount

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

**Entry-auth JWT work** (T010–T015) can run entirely in parallel with **rooms-service scaffold** (T001–T009).

**Within US1**: T022, T023, T025, T028 can all run in parallel once T008+T009 are done.

**Within US4**: T038 + T039 run in parallel (different endpoints); T040 + T041 run in parallel (different UI interactions in same component).

**Frontend work** (T025 onward) can start early — React context and API client have no backend runtime dependency (only type shape).

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP = Phase 3 (US1) complete**: User can log in, see the room list with full room cards, and click Join. This delivers SC-001 and FR-001/FR-002/FR-004/FR-009.

**Increment 2 = Phase 4 (US2)**: Add room creation. Delivers SC-002, FR-005/FR-006/FR-007/FR-012.

**Increment 3 = Phase 5 (US3)**: Empty state polish. Delivers FR-008.

**Increment 4 = Phase 6 (US4)**: Rename + delete with creator-only enforcement. Delivers FR-013/FR-014/FR-015. Frees cap slots on delete.

**Increment 5 = Final Phase**: JWT refresh, real-time updates.
